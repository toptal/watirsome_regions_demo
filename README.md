This is a demo of the improvements made to `regions` API of `watirsome`.

How to use it:

```shell
# clone this repo, then:
cd watirsome_regions_demo

# install dependencies
bundle install

# run the specs
bundle exec rspec
```

Please refer to `spec/todo_lists_spec.rb` and `spec/pages/todo_lists_page.rb` 
to learn how to design a page object model, that allows for reusable
and nestable regions.

The example page used for this demo
[can be found here](https://bwilczek.github.io/watir_pump_tutorial/todo_lists.html).
